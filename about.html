    <p>
      Hi there! I'm Jen, a graphic designer living in Boston, MA. I'm a recent graduate from Emmanuel College with a BFA in graphic design. I'm currently enrolled in the Startup Institute, where I'm improving my skills and growing my network.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      From my education I've learned a wide range of design. From print to web, chances are I've dabbled in it. My favorite areas have been motion graphics and front end development, though I've enjoyed experiencing all sorts of different mediums. I'm confident in my abilities as a designer, but I'm always eager to expand my skill set and improve on the things I already know.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm passionate about the work I do, but always eager to learn. I know how to work with a deadline, how to take direction, and how to work as part of a team. I'm level headed, and like to approach things honestly. I genuinely enjoy receiving critique on my work, how else will I learn and improve?
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm great at compromising and mediating, and I know when or when not to stick to my guns. Working in a group can be very challenging as people can be unpredictable, but coming together as a team and overcoming those challenges is so rewarding. Having a good sense of humor helps too!
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not designing I enjoy singing, gaming, sewing, and doing yoga.
